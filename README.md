I try to keep this as simple as I could so I wouldn't confuse myself an I mainly referenced back to previous lessons just to make sure it would work and it would make it a lot eaiser on myself.
The challenged I face was one getting local storage to actually work and make sure that the input would run through the console another and main issuse is that I keep nothing simple and had to add extra things which 
then messed up another part of my code 
Then i just used local storage for the name,email,age and message input
